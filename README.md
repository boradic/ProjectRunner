How to Download and Run the Game

Follow these steps to play the game on your Windows PC:

Download the Build Folder

Go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name

Click the "Code" button

Select "Download ZIP"

Extract the ZIP file to a location on your computer

Run the Game

Open the extracted folder

Locate the Build folder (or the folder containing the game files)

Inside the folder, find the .exe file (for example, MyGame.exe)

Double-click the .exe file to start the game

Note: Do not move the .exe file out of the folder. It needs the other files (like .data and .dll files) to work properly. Keep all files in the same folder.
